## Address-Book-GUI

- This is a simple sql-python connectivity script, that lets a user store Contact data using a gui.
- Storage is done via sqlite3
- Works perfectly(with size ratios and all leading to button hiding etc.) on Fedora. Though problems may arise on macos and windows with the button sizes and overlays
### Dependencies:
- Python 
- tkinter
- sqlite3 module

### TODO:
- [] Add frames for buttons to ensure that they hide after click.(for macos and windows fix)
- [] Make a tabular display feature
- [] Make a mysql version
- [] Clean Up and document code.
